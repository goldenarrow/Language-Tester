Language-Tester
===============
I recommend downloading the master branch to create your own databases, the absed branch is for my own databse for Japansese. Use the new language option to create a new language in the database and use the new word option in that language's menu to add new words to it. You can use the test command to go through a test of all your words in a random order. Follow the instructions and you should be fine. Happy language learning!
